              Feldman's Russian accent was a little difficult to understand but it was not a big deal because self-teaching and TA are the two most important factors in this course. If you are to take this course, prepare to study by yourselves and
              make sure your TA is helpful. Feldman's three exams are easy. People normally take this class as a prerequisite for MATH 341.</p>

              slides are uploaded periodically. The discussion sections of this course are labs, following the structure of the lab notebook. Labs are generally group observations and individual writing tasks to answer the questions. There are two
              projects in the lab: mystery primate project and mystery hominin project, which are speculating species based on their skulls. Being able to observe skulls is important in the labs. Another reason I chose this course was that it was an
              honors optional course. To receive the optional honors credit, I was required to attend four honors talks (essentially lectures) and write four 800 words report regarding those talks. Here is my <a href="files/Honor-talk-notes.docx"

              with the TAs. One good thing that I can think of about this course is that the scores of the first two midterms can be overriden by the score of the final exam, which means that if you do well in the final, the scores of the midterms do
              not matter. Marc is from Canada and that is why there are answers like the picture on the left when answering problems on Tophat.</p>

              end of the semester. If you are interested in classic myths such as the Olympian gods (Zeus, Hera, Heracles, ...), you should certainly consider this course. If you are a student in the honors program of liberal arts, this course is an
              awesome honors only course that also satisfies the literature requirement under humanities. Another similar literature course that also has an honors only session is ILS 203. However, this course is more difficult than ILS 203.</p>

              previously. I even felt like I had comparable workload in ESL 117 as I had in ESL118. The overall course structure is very similar to it of ESL 117. Three major essay make up the overall structure: SRP, GRP, and IRP and there are small
              assignments that go along with the essays to construct the skeleton of the course and help us to complete those essays. Presentation is also a requirement in this course because this course tends to satisfy the COMM A requirement. As
              long as you put effort into this course, A is not hard. Also, the instructor is very important and your grade depends a lot on the instructors.</p>

              be the prerequisite for many upper level math courses. This course introduces basic concepts of linear algebra such as subspaces, linear tranformation, matrix, etc. Many theorems and propositions are introduced along with some of their
              proofs as well. The exams are not difficult but requires especially skills of proofs. Justin is a great instructor who gives clear lectures and addresses questions quickly. When this class turned online because of COVID-19, the lecture

              learn more about R. Each course is one-credit and lasts a month. The major grades in STAT 303 are quizzes (unlimited tries), homework assignments, and the final exam, which are all pretty easy. STAT 304 is similar to STAT 303 but it
              does not have an exam. STAT 305 is again similar but it does not have an exam and does not have quizzes. Homework assignments in 304 and 305 take some time to complete. Dr. Bo Yang has been teaching these three courese for a while.

Every week has two homeweek assignments expect for exam weeks. The homework assignemts take hours to complete. There is an exam bi-weekly. But for a normal semester, it may be a little bit better. I think it is a good course for math, stats, or cs major students to take since this course is a crossover of these three courses.
