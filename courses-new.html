                            <p>Another name for this course is Calculus III. This is the third and
                                last course of the calculus series of courses at UW-Madison. It is a 4-credit class
                                but does not have the workload for a 4-credit course. Professor
                                Feldman's Russian accent was a little difficult to understand but it was not a big
                                deal because self-teaching and TA are the two most important factors in this course.
                                If you are to take this course, prepare to study by yourselves and
                                make sure your TA is helpful. Feldman's three exams are easy. People normally take
                                this class as a prerequisite for MATH 341.</p>

                            <p>This is a popular course for fulfilling the biological science
                                requirement. This course is about the evolution of primates, such as the origins,
                                behaviors, and chacteristics of different species of primates. Lecuter
                                slides are uploaded periodically. The discussion sections of this course are labs,
                                following the structure of the lab notebook. Labs are generally group observations
                                and individual writing tasks to answer the questions. There are two
                                projects in the lab: mystery primate project and mystery hominin project, which are
                                speculating species based on their skulls. Being able to observe skulls is important
                                in the labs. Another reason I chose this course was that it was an
                                honors optional course. To receive the optional honors credit, I was required to
                                attend four honors talks (essentially lectures) and write four 800 words report
                                regarding those talks. Here is my <a href="files/Honor-talk-notes.docx"

                                UW-Madison. There is only one class per week. The class is purely music

                                AP Computer Science. It is notorious for its heavy workload. Tophat is used for
                                attendence and participation by answering questions on it. There are
                                weekly assignments that make up the complete cycle of learning in this course. There
                                is zyBooks, zyLabs, and discussions. Discussions are labs in which you and another
                                partner of yours work together to solve problems and discuss them
                                with the TAs. One good thing that I can think of about this course is that the
                                scores of the first two midterms can be overriden by the score of the final exam,
                                which means that if you do well in the final, the scores of the midterms do
                                not matter. Marc is from Canada and that is why there are answers like the picture

                                and help us to complete those essays. Presentation is also a requirement in this
                                course because this course tends to satisfy the COMM A requirement. As
                                long as you put effort into this course, A is not hard. Also, the instructor is very
                                important and your grade depends a lot on the instructors.</p>

                            <p class="desc-text">This course is linear algebra based on proofs. If you are not a
                                math major and only needs to fulfill the linear algebra requirement for other
                                majors, MATH 340 should do it. But if you are a math major, MATH 341 will
                                be the prerequisite for many upper level math courses. This course introduces basic
                                concepts of linear algebra such as subspaces, linear tranformation, matrix, etc.
                                Many theorems and propositions are introduced along with some of their
                                proofs as well. The exams are not difficult but requires especially skills of
                                proofs. Justin is a great instructor who gives clear lectures and addresses
                                questions quickly. When this class turned online because of COVID-19, the lecture
                                videos/notes were the best among all my other online courses.</p>

                                303 (Introductory Level) is required for statistics major, but STAT 304 and STAT 305
                                (Intermediate and Advanced Levels) can be helpful if you want to
                                learn more about R. Each course is one-credit and lasts a month. The major grades in
                                STAT 303 are quizzes (unlimited tries), homework assignments, and the final exam,
                                which are all pretty easy. STAT 304 is similar to STAT 303 but it
                                does not have an exam. STAT 305 is again similar but it does not have an exam and
                                does not have quizzes. Homework assignments in 304 and 305 take some time to
                                complete. Dr. Bo Yang has been teaching these three courese for a while.

                                take hours to complete. There is an exam bi-weekly. But for a normal semester, it
                                may be a little bit better. I think it is a good course for math, stats, or cs major
                                students to take since this course is a crossover of these three courses. And we are

                                Topics include sampling, estimation (method of moments, maximum likelihood), hypothesis
                                testing, likelihood ratio test, two-sample, ANOVA, ... For me, we had weekly assignments
                                expect for the weeks for two midterms and one final. I think understanding the material
                                is really important in order to be successful in the course, and doing homeworks is
                                great way to do that.

                                study. It is the most difficult course for me during fall 2020 semester. The course
                                topics include the real, sets, metric space and basic topology, sequences and series,
                                limits, continuity, differentiation, integration, sequences, and series of functions,
                                uniform convergence... Some topics were briefly covered in calculus, but in analysis, we
                                more or less re-define everything and intenstively prove definitions and theorems. If
                                you are not into proofs, this might not be the course to take and there are many other
                                500-level math classes to choose from. If you were to take this course for future
                                purposes, make sure to understand the discussion sections, especially for Professor

                                online. The live sessions of the course were interactive and there was a great
                                environment of learning and dicussing. The course is basically about Ancient
                                Mediterranean, Greek, and Roman cultures. We read many books such as Gilgamesh, the
                                Iliad, the Odyssey, the Aeneid, Ovid selections, Dante selections, etc. There was no
                                midterm and the final was simliar to weekly check-in quizzes. This is probably one of
                                the best literature courses.

                                This course introduced and covered many concepts and ideas, such as command line, hash
                                table, binary search trees (red black tree, AVL trees), sets and graphs,
                                HTML/CSS/JavaScript, JavaFX, Git, ... This was an easy course because we did not dig in
                                for every possible concept introduced and grasping the general idea was pretty much
                                sufficient. There were many assignments in the beginning
                                of the semester, but it was adjusted properly in the middle of the semester. The group
                                projects can be stressful if you do not have responsible teammates. Nonetheless, this
                                was an easy and useful course.

                            <p class="desc-text">Honestly, this course should be a 3-credit course since it had
                                assignments almost weekly and four exams. The assignments were not easy to complete, but
                                the exams were better since they were based on the homeworks. The course topics include
                                bits/data types/operations, logic structures, the von Neumann Model, LC-3, some assembly
                                language, subroutine, and trap routines. This course is really about getting into the
                                basics of computer and programming. It may be a difficult 2-credit course but if you
                                think it as a 3-credit course, it is an OK one. And understanding material in this
                                course certainly prepares you for CS 354 if you are pursuing a CS degree.

                            <p class="desc-text">This course is the well-known course right after CS 252. As shown on
                                the left, the course is broken down to 3 components. The first section introduces
                                programming in C, including data structures, pointers, functions, etc. The second
                                section introduces assembly language. One main goal is to translate between C code and
                                the x86 assembly language. The last section gives a brief introduction to the operating
                                system, which can be a useful overview for those who may take CS 537 in the future. In
                                general, it is a somehow difficult class and focuses on details a lot. We had 4
                                projects and 3 exams in total (some sections may have more projects, say 6). Mike was a
                                good teacher, but there were definitely interruptions and times when we did not stick to
                                the course schedule so strictly during the semester, which was a problem for many
                                students.

                                well. One good thing about the exams is that they gave a week to complete them, which is

                                The homeworks are written using R, so some previous knowledge of R is very useful.

                            <h3>MATH 632</h3>
                            <p class="desc-text"> This is a popular class for either a math or stats major. After taking
                                this course, I felf that stochastic processes can be really useful in many fields,
                                including but definitely not limited to math/stat modeling, physics, finance, etc. The
                                course includes important topics such as discrete-time and continuous-time Markov
                                Chains, martingales, and renewal processes/Poisson processes. Strong knowledge in
                                probability would help a lot in this course (also a little bit of linear algebra maybe).
                                Professor Shcherbina is one of the best professors in the 2021 spring semester for me.
                                She explains concepts clearly and uses examples that are easy to follow and understand.
                                She also cares about students and the exams and grading are fair.

                            <p class="desc-text"> This is the easiest class for me during the 2021 spring semester.
                                Normally, this course is used as a pre-requisite for CS 577. However, I took MATH 475
                                before this course and use that as a pre-requisite for CS 577, which sounds like
                                back-tracking. And after learning many CS and math concepts in other courses, this
                                course became very easy for me. Therefore, this course is all about basic CS and math
                                concepts, especially those used in algorithms and combinatorics. CS 577 and MATH 475 are
                                definitely two courses to consider after taking this course. This course is very useful
                                also by establishing solid foundations of CS/MATH concepts and definitions for the
                                students. Professor Ola is one of the best professors that I had at UW-Madison. She is
                                very organized and explains concepts very clearly and easy to understand. There were
                                almost weekly quizzes and 3 exams. Assignments include weekly reading assignments and
                                homeworks (on McGraw Hill, rarely hand-written).

                                It intends to attract math major students who are interested in learning about data
                                science with a mathematics perspective. Moreover, it can
                                serve as a mathematical companion to machine learning and statistics courses.
                                Content-wise it is a second course in linear algebra, vector calculus, and
                                probability motivated by and illustrated on data science applications. The frequency of
                                homeworks is about bi-weekly. There were 3 exams, which are all take-home ones.
                                Professor Nan Chen has one of the cleanest slides and is a really good professor.

                                UW-Madison. It is a really high-quality honors course. I learned about music a long time
                                ago and this course gives me ideas and perspectives in a relatively new realm, which I
                                was really excited about. There were many music concepts in music theory. Starting from
                                the basics of how to read the notes and intervals to eventually evaluate real music and
                                write music ourselves, this course is a great journey! Definitely recommend this if you
                                are
                                in the L&S honors program and it is also a great choice if you are into the basics of
                                music theory. Dr. Jamie Henke is an awesome instructor. She offers tremendous help for
                                those who may not have a music background. The assignments she has are very
                                educational and also fun to work on. The most unique assignment is a music journal,
                                which are built incrementally by small weekly assignments and listening maps.

                                systems and applications. We had weekly labs and lectures which introduce basic mobile
                                ideas and implementations in Android Studio. These are fun to complete and learn from.
                                Aside from the software side of things, we
                                also learn about mobile sensors and mobile networking. Throughout the semseter, each
                                group would need to work on their project, which is an idea initiated by the group
                                itself. The project occupies a relatively large percentage of the grade. If you are into
                                the mobile side of things, this is the course to go. It is relatively easy considering
                                its counter-parts in the higher level CS courses.

                                were 3 problems sets (completed individually) and 3 programming projects (completed in
                                groups). Professor Paris Koutris has great slides and manages the learning pace of the
                                course very well. We have class on Mondays, Wednesday, and Fridays and we sometimes gets
                                Friday off thanks to Paris. The course has two parts: 1. Databases from the user’s
                                perspective: SQL, ER model and DB design, Relational Algebra. 2. Database internals:
                                basics, indexes, query processing, and transactions. There was a mid-term exam and a
                                final. For the exams, you really need to get into the details of the content and fully
                                understand the material in order to do well.

                                This is a relatively new course in the stats department. It is normally taught by <a
                                    href="https://sebastianraschka.com/" target="_blank">Sebastian Raschka</a>. However,
                                it was taught by <a href="https://stat.wisc.edu/staff/gillett-john/"
                                    target="_blank">John Gillett</a> for the first time in the 2022 spring semester.
                                This
                                course is much easier compared
                                to Sebastian's
                                version of the course, which focuses on the machine learning side of things more
                                technically and rigorously. Throughout the course, we have learned basic ML concepts
                                including SVM, regression, decision tree, k-NN, random forest, etc. The Scikit-learn
                                library is used extensively in the course. John has made the course accessible for
                                people who do not have much programming experience. So, the course has python basics and
                                machine learning material interchangeably. Here is a schedule of the course in spring
                                2022: <a href="https://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~jgillett/451/schedule.html"
                                    target="_blank">link</a>. The course has small weekly quizzes, a midterm, and a
                                final project. The course workload is small and it is a very basic course of machine
                                learning.

                                Personally, I think this is a much better course from John than STAT 451 this semester.
                                Linux virtual machines are first used to introduce basic commands, Git, and emacs. Shell
                                scripts are also a big emphasis. Then, we used the High Performance Computing Cluster
                                (HPC) and employed resources at the Center for High Throughput Computing (<a
                                    href="https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/" target="_blank">CHTC</a>). We have learned skills
                                to manage and analyze large data files (10GB-100GB) using the aforementioned resources,
                                including writing shell scripts, running parallel jobs, and statistical analysis. There
                                are 4 homeworks, several small group exercises, and a final project (<a
                                    href="https://pages.stat.wisc.edu/~jgillett/479/schedule.html"
                                    target="_blank">schedule</a>). No exams. This is a
                                great course if you want to learn to work on virtual machines and HPC/CHTC both for
                                stats and cs students. Side note: John did a much better job teaching emacs than any CS
                                400 instructor.

                                This is my last CS class at UW-Madison. In general, JS is used extensively in the
                                course. We use Canvas for 2D graphics and Three.js for 3D. Details are really emphasized
                                in terms of the course material, so it's never about just using the API. An overview of
                                the concepts include graphics basics, transformations, curves, 3D graphics, lighting,
                                animation, rotations, shaders, etc. Prof. Gleicher has a really nice website that
                                contains comprehensive course material and organization for each semester (spring 2022:
                                <a href="https://pages.graphics.cs.wisc.edu/559-sp22/pages/course-overview/"
                                    target="_blank">link</a>). The workload of this course is comparable to other
                                500-level CS courses. There are weekly workbooks which you read and complete the coding
                                exercises. There are 3 exams in the form of Canvas quizzes. There is a large final
                                project that you can express your artistic and coding abilities to a great extent (a

                                This is a relatively easy stats elective course. The course is well-structured and there
                                are only 4 homeworks in total. There is 1 midterm and 1 final project (similar to a
                                larger homework). The non-parametrics concepts include order statistics, randomness
                                tests (ordinary runs & runs up and down), GOF tests (Pearson chi square,
                                Kolmogoros-Smirnov, and Lilliefors), 1 sample tests (rank order, sign, and Wilcoxon), 2

                                This is the last honors course for me at UW-Madison. Prof. Daniel Williford is very
                                knowledgable in the field of STS and the learning environment is great! The honors
                                discussion sections with him is always a time when I can learn something new and gain
                                insights on the issues at stake. The course workload is above average. There are weekly
                                readings that are about 30 pages and reading responses are needed after the reading.
                                There are 1 midterm, and 1 final exam. There are one short paper (3-page) and one final
                                paper (4-5 pages, and 7 pages for honors). The course discusses STS concepts in a wide
                                range: science, political technologies, social histories of medicine and
                                experimentation, genders, feedback loops/asymmetrical collusion, expertise,
                                quantification, race, biological sciences, environment, etc.
